<p>The following example session with screenshots was carried out with
an early NAPROCHE version programmed in SWI-Prolog, running under
Suse-Linux and TeXmacs.</p>
<p>Start up the TeXmacs editor with the NAPROCHE plugin. The header line
of TeXmacs will contain a "Proof-Checker" button. When pressed, it
initiates proof checking of the current buffer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Plain text editing with TeXmacs proceeds in the usual way. The
mathematical mode is obtained by typing a $-sign. Mathematical symbols
like α can be entered by using the standard LaTeX commands and pressing
&lt;enter&gt;. So ∖a l p h a and &lt;enter&gt; produces an α.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A logical "and" (∧) can typed as ∖w e d g e or obtained with one
mouse-click from the symbol menues provided in the mathematical mode, in
this case from the menue denoted by ℘ .</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>One can leave the mathematical mode by leaving the blue box around
the mathematical text using the right-arrow keys (→) or by typing
another $-sign.</p>
<p>The text typed so far is treated as a comment by the proof-checker.
Only text in the quotation environment is proof-checked. The quotation
environment is available by typing &lt;\<em>quotation</em>&gt; (i.e., ∖q
u o t a t i o n &lt;enter&gt;), or by using the menues Text &gt;
Environment &gt; Quotation. Writing inside the quotation environment is
possible just like outside.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-5.jpeg" /></p>
<p>There are various editing tools like copying text by marking it with
the mouse and pasting it by ctrl-y or by klicking the middle mouse
button.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-6.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The proof of the De Morgan equivalence proceeds in the standard way.
Assume the left-hand side of the equivalence in order to obtain the
right-hand side. A proof by contradiction may be initiated by "Assume
for a contradiction that". Assumptions can be freely introduced in a
proof. Note that the status line usually shows the internal state of the
editor.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-7.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The status line is also used by the NAPROCHE system for the two
possible messages of the checker: "The proof is accepted" and "The proof
is NOT accepted". So if one presses the Proof-Checker button now, the
proof will be accepted, since the proof so far only consisted of the
introduction of assumptions.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-8.jpeg" /></p>
<p>If we introduce an (orthographical) mistake into the proof like
starting a sentence with a small letter, the proof checker rejects the
proof.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-9.jpeg" /></p>
<p>So we correct the spelling mistake and continue the proof by assuming
¬α. Then α can be deduced from the assumption α∧β, and a contradiction
can be deduced from the ¬α and α.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-10.jpeg" /></p>
<p>This is vindicated by the proof-checker:</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-11.jpeg" /></p>
<p>This means that the <em>last</em> assumption implies a contradiction.
This conclusion is expressed by the keyword "Thus":</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-12.jpeg" /></p>
<p>We proceed similarly for β:</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-13.jpeg" /></p>
<p>So each <em>case</em> of the disjunction ¬α∨¬β leads to a
contradiction. So the converse ¬(¬α∨¬β) of the last open assumption
holds. This consequence is also indicated by a "Thus".</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-14.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Another application of "Thus" shows the left-to-right direction of
the equivalence.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-15.jpeg" /></p>
<p>A "Qed." requires checking the last open theorem against the
statements established so far. Since the left-to-right implication does
not imply the equivalence, the proof ended by "Qed." at this point is
rejected.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-16.jpeg" /></p>
<p>  Thus we remove the "Qed." and start the converse direction:</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-17.jpeg" /></p>
<p>To prove α∧β from this assumption, one assumes ¬α and uses rules of
∨-introduction and contradiction. Similarly one obtains β.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-18.jpeg" /></p>
<p>α and β may be conjoined by ∧-introduction, and one gets the
right-to-left implication.</p>
<p><img src="downloads/2007-Sample-19.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Now we can close the proof by "Qed." since → and ← imply ↔︎.</p>
